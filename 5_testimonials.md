> “Vance was an instrumental partner on the Sonoma County Wood Recovery & Utilization Project. He assessed our county’s vulnerable communities and identified priority forest treatment acres that could protect them from wildfires. He also supported our project with an analysis on the potential number of direct and indirect jobs that could be created through the establishment of a new wood processing facility. We’re appreciative of his effort and collaboration on this project; his involvement greatly increased the value of our final study.” Temra Costa, Director, Regenerative Forest Solutions
